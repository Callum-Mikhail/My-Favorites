      During the winter I spend almost all my free time at the ski hill. I can
      ski for hours without stopping, for me skiing never gets old and always
      offers a challenge. Skiing in the mountains with my friends is by far my
      favorite thing to do.

      when im not skiing I spend some of my spare time playing video games. I
      will usually play on my VR or Xbox. Some of my VR favorites are
      <ul> 
      <li>Rec Room</li>
      <li>Beat Saber</li>
      <li>Bonelab</li>
    </ul>
       But when im on Xbox I usually play
      <ul>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
           <li>Skate 3</li>
          <li>Subnautica</li>
        </ul>

    Hockey season is always very fun. I play community Hockey a couple times per week and I am an Oilers fan. The fast pace of hockey makes it one of my favorite sports.
